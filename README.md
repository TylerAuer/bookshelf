# Purple Bookshelf

A React application to share books with friends. Uses a masonry-style that I build from scratch.

## Technologies

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) to scrape data and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for data migrations. Automatic deployment through [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Potential Enhancements

- **Popovers for ratings stars** - When a user mouses over the stars of a rating, it would be nice for a popover to explain the rating system.

- **Gradient across active filters** - Fancier styling for filters, perhaps using something like `multiple.js`
