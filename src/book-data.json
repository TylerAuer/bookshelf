        "description": "The first of two volumes (I'll believe it when I see it, George), Fire and Blood tells the story of the Targaryens from Aegon the Conqueror's landing in Westeros through the Dance of the Dragons until Aegon III comes of age. <i>Fire and Blood</i> feels encyclopedic. The writing is terse and matter of fact, though Martin's clever prose sneak through. Really, though, this book is just for fans in love with the world of Fire and Ice who just crave more epic worldbuilding.",

        "description": "I’ve learned more from Ezra Klein and his podcast than perhaps any other person. So it is no surprise that Klein has crafted an insightful and original analysis of our current politics. Klein clearly articulates how our identities, once broken into many unrelated parts, have now aligned dramatically at two poles. Weaving in historical research, social psychology, and modern politics, Klein’s new book manages to live up to the promise of its title without retreading the same gut-feeling explanations seen elsewhere.",

If only 0.01 percent of those planets have intelligent life, there should be 4 million intelligent civilizations in our galaxy alone. So, where is everybody? This is the Fermi paradox, the crucial idea driving research into extraterrestrial life. Frank’s book serves as a history of the study of aliens, from ancient Greece to modern day. While enjoyable for those already curious about the subject, this is not the most captivating account of the supremely interesting subject.",

We all accept that our brain pumps our blood and blinks our eyes, but we underestimate the power our subconscious has over our opinions and impulses. The magic of this book is the collection of simple experiments you can try that make the power of your subconscious visible. <i>Blind Spot</i> provides indisputable evidence of your implicit biases but is perhaps a bit too much review for those who have taken a collegiate psychology class.",
