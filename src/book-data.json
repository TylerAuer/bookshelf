The first tale, <i>Tower of Babylon</i> was his first published story and still managed to win a Hugo. <i>Stories of Your Life</i> became the hit-movie <i>Arrival</i>. Other stories explore alternate histories in which scientific discoveries evolved differently. Despite the high-concepts, his stories always feel grounded in human characters allowing readers to explore strange worlds that still somehow feel like the one we inhabit.",
