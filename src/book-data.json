        "description": "The first of two volumes (I'll believe it when I see it, George), Fire and Blood tells the story of the Targaryens from Aegon the Conqueror's landing in Westeros through the Dance of the Dragons until Aegon III comes of age. <i>Fire and Blood</i> feels encyclopedic. The writing is terse and matter of fact, though Martin's clever prose sneak through. Really, though, this book is just for fans in love with the world of Fire and Ice who just crave more epic worldbuilding.",

Other stories explore alternate histories in which scientific discoveries evolved differently. Despite the high-concepts, his stories always feel grounded in human characters allowing readers to explore strange worlds that still somehow feel like the one we inhabit.",

Take one part social psychology study, another part of a current event reinterpreted, finally add a heaping spoonful of rhetorical questions and you've got a Gladwell book. Yet, I can't help but find myself curiosity piqued by the stories and research he juxtaposes. Am I always convince by his conclusions? No. But, this book is by far his most thought provoking for how it frames infamous public figures -- Amanda Knox, Brock Turner, Jerry Sandusky. For me, this stands with <i>The Tipping Point</i> as his best works.",
