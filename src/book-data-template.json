    "description": "Towles short story, <i>You Have Arrived at your Destination</i>, is part of the Forward Collection of science fiction short stories organized by Blake Crouch and, unfortunately, only available on Kindle and Audible. Towles story explores the near future in which parents can see their childâ€™s future before they are born and select a fetus with the life they want. High in concept, but a bit short to really explore it, <i>You Have Arrived at your Destination</i> asks big questions but stops short of investigating them in a way that is satisfying.",
